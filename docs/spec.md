# The kempt standard (`kempt.toml`)

A kempt config repo is one `kempt.toml` plus the config files it references.
The manifest is **fully declarative**: kempt executes only built-in, versioned
primitives. There is no exec/script escape hatch. Every action is reviewable
before it runs.

This document is the standard, versioned by the `spec` field.

## Shape

```toml
[kempt]
spec = 1

[packages.core]
description = "shell, prompt, history, modern CLI tools"

  [[packages.core.install]]
  brew   = { formulas = ["starship", "atuin", "ripgrep", "jq"] }
  winget = ["BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC", "jqlang.jq"]
  apt    = ["ripgrep", "jq"]

  [[packages.core.symlink]]
  from = "config/zsh"
  to = "~/.config/zsh"
  backup = true

[packages.terminal]
description = "Ghostty + tmux + yazi workspace"
needs = ["core"]

  [[packages.terminal.git-clone]]
  repo = "https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect"
  to = "~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-resurrect"

[packages.muster]
description = "local multi-agent coordination bus"
only = { os = "darwin" }

  [[packages.muster.github-release]]
  repo = "schuettc/muster"
  asset = "muster_{os}_{arch}.tar.gz"
  bin = "muster"

  [[packages.muster.json-merge]]
  file = "~/.claude/settings.json"
  merge = { mcpServers.muster = { command = "muster", args = ["mcp"] } }

  [[packages.muster.service]]
  label = "tools.muster.serve"
  program = ["muster", "serve"]

  [[packages.muster.verify]]
  command-exists = "muster"
  version-current = { repo = "schuettc/muster", command = "muster version" }

[profiles.developer]
description = "full toolchain: terminal, editors, agents"
packages = ["core", "terminal", "muster"]

[profiles.minimal]
description = "just a pleasant shell"
packages = ["core"]
```

The `muster` package above is a minimal illustration. For the complete,
production package — MCP registration and session hooks for Claude, Codex, and
Cursor, the tmux mailbox, and the daemon service — run `muster setup --print
kempt` (muster emits this exact block, so it never drifts from what
`muster setup` applies for non-kempt users).

## Primitives (v1, closed set)

The primitive set is closed. When a real capability gap appears, the answer is
a new versioned primitive in kempt, not a script hook.

| Primitive | Safety class | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `install` | software | Per-OS/cross-platform backends: `brew` (formulas/casks/taps), `winget`, `apt`, `npm` (global packages), `pi` (more later). Backends are additive — `npm`/`pi` install on any host that has the runtime, alongside the OS backend. Kempt selects the applicable backends at plan time; a platform with no matching backend skips or plan-errors per `only`/`needs`. `install.npm` and `install.pi` entries may be **pinned** as `name@version` (version embedded in the string — no schema change): kempt then converges to that exact version, reinstalling on `kempt update` when the installed version differs. Unversioned `npm`/`pi` entries are ROLLING: they track the newest published version, rolled forward by `kempt upgrade` and by the `kempt update` roll step, and reported by `kempt outdated`; the offline `plan`/`apply` treat them as presence-only (install if absent, never rolled), so the plan stays deterministic. |
| `github-release` | software | Asset templating `{os}`/`{arch}`; downloads asset + `checksums.txt`, sha256-verifies, stages to `.$bin.new.$$`, atomic `mv -f` into `~/.local/bin` (running daemons keep their inode). |
| `download` | software | Fetch a binary from a domain distribution (not GitHub). Resolves `version` (`latest` by default, or a pinned semver), downloads the family URL, verifies its `.sha256` sidecar, and installs `bin` into `~/.local/bin` via the same stage-and-atomic-`mv` path as `github-release`. See the family-URL contract below. |
| `git-clone` | software | Pinned ref or branch. |
| `service` | software | Backend: launchd (macOS), systemd `--user` (Linux); Windows later. Renders unit/plist, `cmp`-before-reload so unchanged services never restart. Fields: `label`, `program` (argv), plus optional `env`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `keep-alive`, `run-at-load`, `process-type`, `throttle-interval`, `session-type` (mapped to the backend's native keys). |
| `symlink` | files | Repo-relative `from`; `backup = true` moves a real file to `.bak` first. Windows requires Developer Mode — detected and reported in plan, not failed mid-apply. |
| `json-merge` | files | Additive deep merge (jq semantics); idempotent; multiple packages may merge into the same file. `arrays` selects list behavior: `append` (default, union) or `replace` (desired list wins). Covers MCP registration and harness hooks. The literal token `${HOME}` in any merged string value is expanded to the machine's home at write time — for files that do not themselves expand `~` (e.g. codex `hooks.json`, whose command strings need absolute paths). Bare `~` is left untouched. |
| `toml-merge` | files | Additive deep merge for TOML config files (e.g. an agent's `config.toml`); idempotent; maps recurse, arrays append-missing, scalars overwrite. Expands the `${HOME}` token in string values like `json-merge`. |
| `line-in-file` | files | Ensure-line/ensure-block for shell includes and PATH nudges. |
| `verify` | read-only | Declared checks: `command-exists`, `command-exists-any` (any of a list on PATH), `http-ok` (URL returns 2xx), symlink target, `version-current` (GitHub latest-release drift). |

### `download` family-URL contract

The `download` primitive resolves assets from a predictable URL family so a
vendor need only publish files at these paths:

- **Artifact:** `https://<site>/dl/<tool>/<ver>/<tool>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz`
- **Latest pointer:** a plain-text document holding a bare semver (e.g. `1.4.2`),
  used when `version` is `latest` or omitted, to resolve `<ver>`.
- **Checksum:** a shasum-format `.sha256` sidecar alongside the artifact
  (`<artifact>.sha256`), verified before install.

`<os>`/`<arch>` use kempt's normalized platform tokens (same as `github-release`
asset templating).

### `download` version field

The `version` field controls whether a download rolls automatically or locks to a
manifest-pinned version. When omitted, `version` defaults to `"latest"`.

**`version = "latest"`** (rolling): The download fetches the latest available
release each time. In `plan` output, it is presence-only — `plan` shows it only
if the tool is already installed, never as a change to apply. Use `kempt outdated`
to check for new releases and `kempt upgrade` to install them; `kempt update` also
rolls latest tools via its roll step.
`outdated`, `upgrade`, and the `kempt update` roll step are the only paths that
reach the network for versions; `plan`/`apply` never do.

**`version = "x.y.z"`** (pinned): The download locks to the specific semver. If
the installed version differs, `plan` shows `upgrade <bin> <old> -> <pin>` drift
offline, and `apply` converges to the pinned version (including a downgrade if
necessary). Version currency is managed separately via `kempt upgrade` and `kempt
outdated`.

Safety class comes from kempt's primitive table — a manifest cannot declare its
own software installs "safe."

Every package may carry a `notes` field — an array of free-form strings surfaced
in plan output (post-install hints, manual follow-ups). Notes are documentation
only; they run nothing.

## Rules

- Steps run in written order within a package; packages run in dependency
  (`needs`) order. Planned for a later spec revision, not part of spec = 1: step-level
  `requires` preflights (e.g. "git exists") that fail the plan, not the apply. A spec = 1
  parser rejects `requires` as an unknown key.
- Every step is idempotent by contract: kempt computes current vs desired and
  no-ops on match. This is what makes plan honest and converge cheap.
- `only = { os, arch }` on packages or steps restricts where they apply; always
  visible in plan output.

## Profiles

Profiles are named package sets (personas: developer, minimal, …), **not**
conditionals. The first-run picker preseeds from the chosen profile. There is no
hostname/env conditional language in v1 — `only = { os, arch }` is the only
conditional.

## Versioning

The manifest declares `spec = 1`. Parsers reject spec values they don't know:
the current engine's `Validate` enforces `spec = 1` and flags anything else.
Future spec revisions bump this field, and older engines refuse manifests from
the future rather than mis-parse them. A published JSON Schema gives TOML LSPs
(taplo) completion and validation while authoring.

## doctor

`kempt doctor` is a read-only machine-vs-manifest drift and health check. It
reports divergence the other commands cannot see by design — the tolerant
semantics that keep `plan` honest also make some drift invisible to it — and it
never mutates the machine. Selection resolves identically to `plan`/`verify`
(the saved selection when flags are omitted); it accepts `-manifest`,
`-profile`, and `-packages`, plus `-json` (machine-readable findings) and
`-strict` (treat `warn`-level findings as failures for the exit code).

Each check yields zero or more **findings**, each carrying a `check` id, a
`severity` (`error`/`warn`/`info`), the attributable `package`, a `detail`, and
a concrete `remediation` string. `doctor` is report-only in v1 — there is no
`--fix`; the remediation is always an existing command (`kempt apply`,
`kempt adopt`, …).

| Check | What it reports | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| **D1** extra-array drift | Live elements of a `json-merge`-managed array the manifest does not declare (the inverse of the subset check `plan` uses, so it fires even for `arrays = "append"` merges). | `warn` (`error` when the step is `arrays = "replace"`) |
| **D2** duplicate identity | Entries in a managed array that normalize to the same identity — a trailing `@version` and the `npm:`/`git:` scheme are stripped, so `npm:pi-quiet@0.2.0` ≡ `npm:pi-quiet`; git identity is the repo URL without `@ref`, local is the resolved path. | `warn` |
| **D3** orphaned installs | Installed software absent from the manifest: `pi list` vs the union of `install.pi` specs, and (opt-in) `npm ls -g` vs `install.npm`. | `warn` (pi), `info` (npm) |
| **D4** broken/foreign managed symlinks | For every `symlink` step, `lstat` the `to` path and report broken (dangling), foreign (a real file/dir where the repo symlink belongs — the `backup`-would-fire case), or mispointed links, covering links with no `verify` step. | `error` (broken), `warn` (foreign/mispointed) |
| **D5** plan/verify rollup | Runs the plan and the `verify` steps for the selection and summarizes pending changes, blocked steps, and verify pass/fail, so ordinary "machine is behind the manifest" state shows in the same report. | `info` (blocked steps and verify failures promoted to `error`) |

### Exit codes

- `0` — healthy: no findings at the failing threshold.
- `1` — findings present at the failing threshold (`error` by default; `-strict`
  lowers it to `warn`, so CI can gate hard; `info` never fails).
- `2` — usage/parse error, consistent with the other commands.

### `[doctor]` config

A top-level `[doctor]` block tunes the machine-health checks:

```toml
[doctor]
checkNpmOrphans = false
ignore = ["pi-quiet", "npm:some-tool", "glob:internal-*"]
```

- `checkNpmOrphans` (bool, default `false`) — enable D3's npm-orphan comparison.
  Off by default because a global npm install set is noisy with hand-installed
  tools.
- `ignore` (array of strings) — suppress known-intentional out-of-band installs
  from the orphan check. Each entry is either an exact spec, a backend-qualified
  id (`npm:<id>`), or a glob (`glob:<pattern>`).

### lint invariant (offline)

`kempt lint` enforces one manifest-internal rule that `doctor` does not: when a
package declares both an `install.pi` list and a `json-merge` that writes the pi
settings' `packages` array, the two lists must match **string-for-string**
(order-insensitive set equality, exact strings). This replaces the previous
comment-and-discipline convention so a mismatch fails offline at lint time before
it ever reaches a machine. The rule keys on "an `install.<backend>` list and a
`json-merge` writing that backend's registry array in the same package," so it
generalizes to a future npm equivalent.

## Implementation status

- `kempt lint` — shipped (unknown keys, spec validation, structural checks,
  install-list ↔ settings-merge `packages` string-for-string invariant).
- `kempt doctor` — shipped (read-only machine-vs-manifest drift/health check;
  D1–D5 findings, `[doctor]` config, `-json`, `-strict`).
- `kempt plan` / `apply` / `init` / `update` — in progress (phases 1b–1c).
